# house-price-prediction
Project Description
This project focuses on predicting house prices using a comprehensive dataset. The primary goal is to build a robust model that accurately forecasts the prices of houses based on various features in the dataset.
1. data.csv: This dataset contains [describe the content of the data, e.g., sales records, user data, etc.].
2. cleaned_data.csv: This is the processed version of data.csv, with [describe the cleaning or preprocessing steps taken, e.g., missing values removed, columns standardized, etc.].
3. Developed models to predict house prices using various machine learning algorithms-linear regression.
4. Selected the best model based on performance metrics.
5. Identified and removed outliers to improve model accuracy.
6. Re-assessed the modelâ€™s performance after the removal of outliers.
